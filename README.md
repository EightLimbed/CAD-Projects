### CAD-Projects:
Collection of various 3D printed, or generally modelled projects, some of which were ued as school projects.


### Perfectly Aerodynamic 3D Printed Car:
This was made for my grade 11 physics final project. The objective was to create a car that rolled as far as possible off the end of a ramp, meaning the most important property was aerodynamics. My car went the furthest (10.7m), nearly doubling the distance of second place.

Some frame by frame analysis showed the car reached a top speed of 3.57m/s from the 68cm high ramp (angled at 19Â° to the horizontal), and was 96% efficient in terms of energy loss from various sources of friction.
